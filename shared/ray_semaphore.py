    Ray actor that implements a distributed semaphore.

    Uses asyncio internally to handle concurrent acquire/release requests.

    Cancellation safety
    -------------------
    ``acquire`` returns a unique ``ticket`` string that the caller must pass
    to ``release``.  The actor tracks tickets in ``_granted_tickets``; a
    ``release`` with an unknown (or already-released) ticket is a no-op.
    This prevents over-release when a client's ``acquire.remote()`` call is
    cancelled after the actor granted the slot — a subsequent unconditional
    release would otherwise leak the slot to a phantom holder.

    Client-side cancellation is handled by the ``SemaphoreContext`` wrapper,
    which shields the acquire RPC and — if the caller is cancelled while the
    acquire is in flight — schedules a detached release once the ticket
    arrives.  The actor itself therefore needs only ticket-aware release.
